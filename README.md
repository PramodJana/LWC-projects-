Define a Component

A Lightning web component that renders UI must include an HTML file, a JavaScript file, and a metadata configuration file. The files must use the same name so the framework can autowire them.

The folder and its files must have the same name, including capitalization and underscores.

The folder and its files must follow these naming rules.

1. Must begin with a lowercase letter
2. Must contain only alphanumeric or underscore characters
3. Must be unique in the namespace
4. Can’t include whitespace
5. Can’t end with an underscore
6. Can’t contain two consecutive underscores
7. Can’t contain a hyphen (dash)
